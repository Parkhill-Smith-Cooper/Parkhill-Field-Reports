/**
 * The four workflow steps, defined once.
 *
 * Each step is a real route rather than an index held in component state.
 * On a phone the browser back gesture is the primary way people navigate, and
 * with a step counter "back" leaves the app and destroys the engineer's field
 * notes. With routes it walks the wizard, and the draft survives because the
 * React context lives in the wizard layout, which client-side navigation does
 * not remount.
 *
 * This module is shared by the step indicator (to render progress), the step
 * guards (to decide what is reachable) and the pages themselves (to navigate),
 * so those three can never disagree about the order of the workflow.
